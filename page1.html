For my capstone, I reviewed 2 datasets from OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) hoping to identify ways that a tech employer might mitigate the potential impact on productivity resulting from mental health issues.
<br><br>The bulk of my time was spent cleaning the data but once I was through that ordeal I came up with a “danger” score indicating the level of mental health supports respondents were aware of. Across the whole dataset, I was not able to confirm a correlation between the danger score and impact to productivity, though I’m curious to have another look on a role by role basis. <br><br>It’s not clear from the data whether productivity loss and lack of supports are unrelated or whether the data collection by survey has impacted the accuracy of the results. I did, however, find that the perception that disclosing mental health issues would have negative consequences was the highest contributor to the danger score.</p>

Mental health is a keen interest of mine so while my course may now be complete, it is highly likely I will return to this project from time to time. I look forward to seeing what new insights might be revealed as the whirlwind of information from the course takes root in my brain and I continue to build on my learnings thus far.&nbsp;<br><br><div>
</div><div>When I found OSMI's datasets I was jubilant. Publicly available data on mental health in IT! How quickly I had forgotten "The data is always dirty" - the sage advice from an alumnus on commencing our course. He also suggested that 80% of data science is cleaning and EDA (exploratory data analysis) but this was a very conservative figure in my experience. Ultimately I had to find a point where the data was 'clean enough'. I'm still itching to go back and clean it some more.&nbsp;</div><br><div>My goal for this project was to identify ways an employer might mitigate the potential impact on productivity resulting from mental health issues. I was also curious whether any specific role had a significantly higher (or lower) risk of productivity loss than others.&nbsp;</div></div>

This compared with one day out of their role for people with no physical or mental condition.
<br><br>The accompanying graph shows reported impact on productivity broken down by primary job role. Blue is the responses indicating no mental health-related interference with work. Orange shows responses indicating any impact whether frequent or infrequent. In most roles, more than half of responses indicated some productivity loss.
<br><br>My next step was to examine what employer supports were in place, or more accurately, supports the respondents were aware of.&nbsp;<br>
From this data, I created a pain or danger score. The higher the score the less supported the employee might feel.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<br>
<br>This graph shows high and low danger scores by position. Happily, team lead/supervisor roles had a lower incidence of high danger scores, I would suggest this is due to higher exposure to, and awareness of, available supports and internal programs. The same applies to executive leadership. Interestingly it appears that front and back-end developers and sales are the only roles with more high scores than low scores. 
<br><br>
My next step to check the relationship between the danger score and impact to productivity.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

More respondents who indicated no disruption to their work had high danger scores than had low. And more of the respondents reporting disruption had lower danger scores. I was perplexed but it's important to remember insights are only ever as good as the data they come from. Surveys are not necessarily the most reliable or objective means of collecting data. Are some workers not reporting disruption to work because there is no room to allow disruption? Perhaps some are not aware that they're experiencing mental health related symptoms. 
<br>It's also possible that the division of high and low scores was a little generous. In this case, a low score is simply a score below the median. The median danger score being 16. If a respondent indicated significant difficulty in being able to take mental health related leave this contributed only 2 points to their danger score, making 16 a very high score.<br></p>

What I did find, however, were the top contributors to the danger score. The biggest contributor to the danger score was a perception of negative workplace consequences for disclosing mental health issues, closely followed by being uncomfortable discussing mental health with supervisors. Being uncomfortable discussing mental health with co-workers, concerns of disclosing mental health issues harming their career and employers not treating mental health as seriously as physical health were also big contributors to the danger score.
<div>&nbsp;
</div><div>If this data related to a single employer, the next steps might be for the employer to start an open dialogue to address the fear of negative consequences from disclosing mental health issues. This, of course, wouldn't immediately result in workers feeling more comfortable discussing mental health matters but could certainly have an impact over time.
</div><div>It would also be useful to identify alternative methods for obtaining data on both the respondents' current mental health and productivity that doesn't rely on asking them directly. I'm imagining occasional screen popups, requiring a single click to respond eg "I'm this productive right now." Possibly coupled with some computer vision and mood recognition. Now that's some data I'd love to sink my teeth into.</div></div>
